# Neural Sprint

This is my 4th year project for my Computer Applications degree.

Neural Sprint is a 2-D side scrolling platform game written in C# and built within the Unity 5 game engine. Also contained within the game is a neural network that I developed in C# using the NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies) genetic algorithm.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use and application of a Neural Network (specifically NEAT) within one of the most common forms of media: Video Games.
